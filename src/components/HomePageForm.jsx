                            Jung introduced groundbreaking concepts that reshaped our understanding of the human psyche.
                            He was instrumental in developing the idea of the collective unconscious, a profound concept
                            suggesting a shared layer of unconsciousness exists across humanity filled with archetypes and universal symbols.
                        </p>
                        <p className="p-3 text-2xl">
                            Jung also believed that dreams offered us a window into this collective unconsciousness. He believed
                            that dreams were not just random neaural firings, but meaningfun reflections of our innermost thoughts
                            and feelings, providing critical insights into personal development and growth. With Dream Oracles, you can ask Carl Jung directly
                            what he thinks your dream means, and he will draw on his books and studies to provide you with a personalized interpretation.

                            Freud, often hailed as the father of psychoanalysis, made monumental contributions to the field of psychology
                            that resonated far beyond his era. Among many other things, Freud&apos;s exploration into the unconscious mind
                            lead to the creation of the structural model of the psyche, comprising of the id, ego, and superego, which 
                            provided a new framework for analyzing human behavior and thought processes.

                            A significant part of Freud&apos;s legacy is his theory of dream analysis, where he also argued that dreams are not 
                            random mental activities but meaningful manifestations of our deepest desires and unresolved conflicts. He believed 
                            interpreting these dream symbols could unlock insights into an individuals&apos;s unconscious mind, offering a pathway 
                            to understanding and treating psychological distress. Ask one of the most prominent dream interpreters in history 
                            what he thinks about your dreams.
