                    Of COURSE you have! We all have woken up from an absolutely insane dream and wondered what the hell just happened. 
                    Most people think that their dreams are just these random things that happen, but they are not random at all.
                    They're the exact opposite. It is your subconscious and unconscious mind communicating something VITALLY important to you.
